# Research Methodology Framework

## Mixed-Methods Research Design

**Approach**: Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods
- **Phase 1**: Quantitative data collection and analysis
- **Phase 2**: Qualitative data collection to explain quantitative findings
- **Phase 3**: Integration and interpretation

## Theoretical Foundations

### 1. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) - Primary Framework
- **Perceived Usefulness**: Degree to which users believe mHealth messaging will enhance job performance
- **Perceived Ease of Use**: Degree to which users believe using the technology will be free of effort
- **Behavioral Intention**: User's intention to use the mHealth messaging platform
- **Actual System Use**: Measured usage behavior and engagement metrics

### 2. Health Belief Model (HBM) - Health Behavior Context
- **Perceived Susceptibility**: Beliefs about the likelihood of health risks without intervention
- **Perceived Severity**: Beliefs about the seriousness of health conditions
- **Perceived Benefits**: Beliefs about the effectiveness of mHealth messaging interventions
- **Perceived Barriers**: Beliefs about the tangible and psychological costs of engagement
- **Cues to Action**: External factors that trigger health-related behaviors
- **Self-Efficacy**: Confidence in one's ability to successfully perform health behaviors

### 3. Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) - Extended Adoption Factors
- **Performance Expectancy**: Degree to which users believe the system will help them attain gains
- **Effort Expectancy**: Degree of ease associated with use of the system
- **Social Influence**: Degree to which users perceive that important others believe they should use the system
- **Facilitating Conditions**: Degree to which users believe organizational and technical infrastructure exists

## Data Collection Strategy

### Quantitative Component
**Design**: Cross-sectional survey study
- **Sample Size**: 300-500 participants (power analysis: 80% power, α = 0.05, medium effect size)
- **Instruments**: 
  - Validated TAM scales (Davis, 1989; Venkatesh & Davis, 2000)
  - mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ)
  - Health Literacy Assessment (HLS-EU-Q16)
  - Custom scales for RCS-specific features
- **Platform Analytics**: Usage metrics, engagement rates, retention data
- **Distribution**: Online survey via Qualtrics, mobile-optimized

**Variables Measured**:
- Independent: Demographics, health status, technology experience, platform type
- Dependent: User adoption, engagement frequency, health outcomes, satisfaction
- Mediating: Perceived usefulness, ease of use, health beliefs
- Moderating: Age, health literacy, prior technology experience

### Qualitative Component
**Design**: Phenomenological approach with grounded theory analysis
- **Semi-structured Interviews**: 20-30 participants (theoretical saturation)
- **Focus Groups**: 3-4 groups with healthcare providers (6-8 participants each)
- **Observational Studies**: 10-15 participants using platforms in naturalistic settings
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes per interview, 90 minutes per focus group

**Interview Domains**:
- User experience and journey mapping
- Technology adoption decision-making process
- Barriers and facilitators to sustained use
- Communication preferences and effectiveness
- Health behavior change experiences
- Privacy and security concerns

### Mixed-Methods Integration
**Convergent Parallel Design**:
- Simultaneous quantitative and qualitative data collection
- Independent analysis of each data type
- Comparison and interpretation of results for comprehensive understanding
- Joint displays and meta-inferences

## Sample Demographics and Recruitment

### Target Population
**Patients**:
- Adults aged 18-75 years
- Diverse health conditions (chronic disease management, preventive care, mental health)
- Varied socioeconomic backgrounds
- Urban, suburban, and rural representation
- English and Spanish speakers

**Healthcare Providers**:
- Physicians, nurses, health educators, care coordinators
- Primary care, specialty care, and community health settings
- Varying levels of technology adoption experience
- Public and private healthcare systems

### Sampling Strategy
**Quantitative**: Stratified random sampling
- Stratification by: age group, health condition, geographic region, platform type
- Recruitment via: healthcare partner organizations, social media, patient registries

**Qualitative**: Purposive sampling with maximum variation
- Theoretical sampling for grounded theory development
- Recruitment via: quantitative survey volunteers, healthcare provider networks

### Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
**Inclusion**:
- Adults 18+ years old
- Current or recent use of mobile health messaging (past 6 months)
- Ability to provide informed consent
- Basic smartphone literacy

**Exclusion**:
- Severe cognitive impairment
- Unable to communicate in English or Spanish
- No access to mobile technology

## Data Analysis Plan

### Quantitative Analysis
**Descriptive Statistics**:
- Demographics, usage patterns, engagement metrics
- Platform comparison across key variables

**Inferential Statistics**:
- Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for TAM/UTAUT path analysis
- Multiple regression for predictor identification
- ANOVA for group comparisons
- Mediation/moderation analysis using PROCESS macro

**Software**: SPSS 29.0, R statistical environment, Mplus for SEM

### Qualitative Analysis
**Coding Framework**:
- Initial open coding using constant comparative method
- Axial coding for relationship identification
- Selective coding for core category development
- Member checking for validation

**Analytical Approach**:
- Thematic analysis following Braun & Clarke (2006)
- Framework analysis for policy-relevant themes
- Grounded theory for process model development

**Software**: NVivo 14, ATLAS.ti for computer-assisted qualitative data analysis

### Integration Strategy
**Joint Displays**: Side-by-side comparison of quantitative and qualitative findings
**Meta-Inferences**: Higher-level interpretations drawing from both data types
**Convergence Assessment**: Agreement, expansion, or discordance between findings

## Ethical Considerations

### Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval
