# Chapter 3: Research Methodology

## 3.1 Research Design

This study employs an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design to comprehensively examine mobile health messaging applications and their impact on patient engagement and health outcomes. The choice of mixed methods is justified by the complexity of the research questions, which require both quantitative measurement of engagement and outcomes and qualitative understanding of user experiences and implementation contexts.

The research design consists of three distinct phases:

**Phase 1 (Quantitative)**: Cross-sectional survey study examining user adoption patterns, engagement behaviors, and clinical outcomes across different messaging platforms (n=450 participants). This phase provides breadth of understanding across a large, diverse sample.

**Phase 2 (Qualitative)**: In-depth interviews and focus groups exploring user experiences, implementation challenges, and contextual factors influencing adoption and sustained use (n=35 individual interviews, 4 focus groups). This phase provides depth and explanatory insights for quantitative findings.

**Phase 3 (Integration)**: Systematic integration of quantitative and qualitative findings to develop comprehensive understanding and practical recommendations. This phase employs joint displays, meta-inferences, and convergence analysis to synthesize insights across data types.

## 3.2 Theoretical Framework

### 3.2.1 Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)

The Technology Acceptance Model serves as the primary theoretical framework for understanding user adoption and continued use of mobile health messaging platforms. The TAM model proposes that technology adoption is primarily determined by two key constructs:

**Perceived Usefulness**: The degree to which users believe that using a mobile health messaging platform will enhance their health management effectiveness or healthcare experience.

**Perceived Ease of Use**: The degree to which users believe that using the messaging platform will be free of effort and technical complexity.

For this study, the TAM framework is extended to include healthcare-specific constructs including perceived health benefit, trust in technology, and privacy concerns. These extensions are necessary because healthcare technology adoption involves unique considerations beyond general technology acceptance.

### 3.2.2 Health Belief Model Integration

The Health Belief Model (HBM) is integrated with TAM to address health-specific motivation factors that influence messaging platform adoption and sustained use. The HBM constructs examined include:

**Perceived Susceptibility**: Beliefs about personal risk for health problems that could be addressed through messaging interventions.

**Perceived Severity**: Beliefs about the seriousness of potential health consequences without intervention.

**Perceived Benefits**: Beliefs about the effectiveness of mobile messaging interventions for addressing health concerns.

**Perceived Barriers**: Beliefs about tangible and psychological costs associated with messaging platform use.

**Cues to Action**: External factors (provider recommendations, peer influence, media coverage) that trigger messaging platform adoption.

**Self-Efficacy**: Confidence in one's ability to successfully use messaging platforms for health management.

### 3.2.3 Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)

UTAUT provides additional constructs for understanding technology adoption in organizational and social contexts. Key UTAUT constructs examined include:

**Performance Expectancy**: The degree to which users believe the messaging system will help them achieve health management goals.

**Effort Expectancy**: The degree of ease associated with messaging platform use.

**Social Influence**: The degree to which users perceive that important others (family, friends, healthcare providers) believe they should use the messaging platform.

**Facilitating Conditions**: The degree to which users believe organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support messaging platform use.

**Moderating Variables**: Age, gender, experience, and voluntariness of use are examined as factors that may moderate the relationships between core constructs and adoption intentions.

## 3.3 Data Collection Methods

### 3.3.1 Quantitative Component

#### Survey Design and Instrument Development

A comprehensive online survey was developed to measure key constructs from the theoretical framework and collect data on messaging platform usage, engagement patterns, and health outcomes. The survey instrument consists of six primary sections:

**Demographics and Health Status** (12 items): Age, gender, education, income, health conditions, healthcare utilization, and technology experience.

**Messaging Platform Usage** (18 items): Current and past use of SMS, RCS, and app-based messaging for health purposes, frequency of use, feature utilization, and platform preferences.

**Technology Acceptance Constructs** (32 items): Validated scales measuring perceived usefulness, ease of use, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Items adapted from established TAM and UTAUT instruments with healthcare-specific modifications.

**Health Belief Model Constructs** (24 items): Perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy related to health messaging platform use.

**Engagement and Outcomes** (15 items): Self-reported health behavior changes, medication adherence, appointment attendance, and satisfaction with healthcare communication.

**Open-Ended Questions** (3 items): Barriers to adoption, suggestions for improvement, and additional comments.

#### Psychometric Properties

All scales underwent rigorous validation procedures including content validity assessment by expert panels, pilot testing with 50 participants, and confirmatory factor analysis to verify construct validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficients exceeded 0.85 for all multi-item scales, indicating excellent internal consistency reliability.

#### Sample Size and Power Analysis

Power analysis using G*Power 3.1.9.7 determined that a sample size of 400 participants would provide 80% power to detect medium effect sizes (f² = 0.15) in multiple regression analyses with up to 15 predictor variables at α = 0.05. To account for potential incomplete responses and dropout, the target sample size was set at 450 participants.

### 3.3.2 Qualitative Component

#### Semi-Structured Interview Protocol

Individual interviews lasting 45-60 minutes were conducted with a purposive sample of 35 participants to explore user experiences, adoption decision-making processes, and contextual factors influencing messaging platform use. The interview protocol consists of five main topic areas:

**Technology Adoption Journey**: How participants first learned about and decided to use health messaging platforms, initial experiences, and factors influencing continued use.

**User Experience and Engagement**: Detailed exploration of platform interactions, preferred features, communication patterns, and satisfaction with different messaging modalities.

**Health Impact and Outcomes**: Perceived effects of messaging platform use on health behaviors, clinical outcomes, healthcare relationships, and overall well-being.

**Barriers and Facilitators**: Challenges encountered during platform use, sources of support, and factors that enabled successful adoption and sustained engagement.

**Future Preferences and Recommendations**: Desired platform improvements, feature requests, and suggestions for enhancing messaging-based health interventions.

#### Focus Group Methodology

Four focus groups were conducted with healthcare providers (physicians, nurses, health educators) to understand organizational perspectives on messaging platform implementation. Each focus group included 6-8 participants and lasted approximately 90 minutes. Focus group topics included:

- Current messaging platform use in clinical practice
- Implementation challenges and organizational barriers
- Provider perceptions of patient engagement and outcomes
- Training and support needs
- Future implementation priorities and concerns

#### Participant Recruitment and Selection

Qualitative participants were recruited through multiple strategies to ensure diverse perspectives:

**Interview Participants**: Recruited through survey responses (participants who indicated willingness to participate in follow-up interviews), healthcare partner organizations, and snowball sampling. Maximum variation sampling was employed to ensure representation across age groups, health conditions, socioeconomic status, and technology experience levels.

**Focus Group Participants**: Healthcare providers were recruited through professional associations, hospital partnerships, and academic medical centers. Participants represented diverse clinical specialties, practice settings, and experience levels with health messaging technologies.

## 3.7 Limitations and Assumptions

### 3.7.1 Methodological Limitations

**Cross-Sectional Design**: The primary quantitative component employs a cross-sectional design, limiting the ability to establish causal relationships between messaging platform use and health outcomes. Longitudinal data would strengthen causal inference but was beyond the scope of this thesis research.

**Self-Report Bias**: Many key variables rely on self-reported data, which may be subject to recall bias, social desirability bias, and response bias. Where possible, objective measures (platform analytics) were incorporated to validate self-reported usage data.

**Selection Bias**: Participants who volunteer for research on health messaging technologies may be more technology-positive than the general population, potentially limiting generalizability of findings.

**Platform Availability**: Access to RCS messaging varies by device type, mobile carrier, and geographic region, which may influence comparative analyses between messaging platforms.

### 3.7.2 Generalizability Considerations

**Geographic Limitations**: Data collection was conducted primarily in [specific geographic region], which may limit generalizability to other healthcare systems, regulatory environments, and cultural contexts.

**Healthcare System Context**: Findings may not generalize to healthcare systems with significantly different organizational structures, technology infrastructure, or reimbursement models.

**Technology Evolution**: The rapid pace of mobile technology development means that findings may have limited applicability as new platforms and features emerge.

**Language and Cultural Factors**: While Spanish-language materials were provided, the study was conducted primarily in English-speaking contexts, potentially limiting applicability to other linguistic and cultural groups.

### 3.7.3 Key Assumptions

**Truthful Reporting**: The analysis assumes that participants provided honest and accurate responses to survey questions and interview prompts.

**Platform Functionality**: The study assumes that messaging platforms operated as intended during the study period, without significant technical disruptions or feature changes.

**Stable Technology Environment**: The analysis assumes that the basic technological and regulatory environment for health messaging remained relatively stable during the data collection period.

**Representative Sampling**: While efforts were made to achieve diverse representation, the study assumes that participants are reasonably representative of the broader population of health messaging platform users.

**Theoretical Framework Validity**: The analysis assumes that the integrated TAM/HBM/UTAUT theoretical framework appropriately captures the key factors influencing health messaging platform adoption and use.

These limitations and assumptions are important considerations for interpreting study findings and identifying areas for future research to address these constraints.
